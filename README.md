# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover new trends
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

	This analysis is to compare how other campaigns have done on their outcomes based on goals and launch dates. With this information, Louise's Play "Fever" can accurately compare how 		her campaign performed with the others.
### Purpose

	The purpose of this analysis is to compare Louise's Campaign with others based on outcomes of launch date and goals. So we can make a much better decision if this chart can give a clear advantage when launching our campaign. 


## Analysis and Challenges

	First, to understand more about other campaigns, we decided to look for which campaigns meet their goals, if it has something to do with lunching date, or if they reached their goal in a specific time.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

	This analysis shows that a campaign is more likeable to reach their goals if it is done from April to June. Maybe the most with the highest approval. We can also deduce there is a low chance of approval on the cold months. At the same time, April to August are the highest months with failed campaigns. However, successful campaigns doubled numbers of failed campaigns on those months. December appears to be a 50% chance of success, the only month in which there is almostThe same amount of approval as failed campaigns.
	
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 
	Around 529 campaigns have a goal between $1 and $4999.75% of these campaigns reach their goals. 132 campaigns with a goal between 5000 and $14999. Have a 55% chance to reach their goal. Based on this chart, most campaigns with a goal between $1000 and $5000 dollars in goals have the highest chance of success. But also, we can assume that most campaigns between the same amount have a 27% failure reaching their goal.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

We would need to dig up more data. The information provided will not be sufficient because it can be biased. 
	

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the outcomes based on the Launch Date?

- May and June are the month with most successful campaigns.
	Seems like spring and summer are the best months to lunch a campaign. 
	

- What can you conclude about the outcomes based on Goals?

	- Projects between $1 and $5000 are the most likeable to reach 	their goal. Also, projects with $1000 to $5000 have a 27% chance 	of failure.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

	We need more questions to give a better explanation. This chart can be biased.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs we could 
Create?
- separate them by location.
		Different locations can have bigger attractions for 	
		This type of investments in which we can have a higher percentage of success.
- Table by pledge money.
		Seems like also some projects have had more money than requested. We could find a pattern or a different taste of play depending on by location.
- Table by Backers
		Also, we could find a different pattern by "backers". We may have hit a niche or specific taste for this type of plays.
